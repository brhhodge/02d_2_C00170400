Programming Assignment:


1. In Visual Studio Code, open your project “02d_1_your-clid”. When the project runs correctly, clean the
project, zip the project folder. Then, name the zip archive “02d_2_your-clid .zip and upload it to
Moodle.


2. In the dirt sample class, remove the expression bodied property that returns the sum of the clay and sand
in the sample. Replace its function by creating an extension method to the class that returns the returns
the sum of the clay and sand in the sample.


3. In the dirt sample class, create methods to overload the equality and inequality operators (== and !=) to
compare two dirt samples.

(a) Two dirt samples are considered equal if the percents of sand and clay in the sample are equal in the
two samples being compared. Tip: It is only necessary to compare the percent of one component

(sand or clay) in the two samples being compared, as there are only two components to the sample.
(b) Two dirt samples are considered equal if the percents of sand and clay in the sample are equal in the
two samples being compared.

(c) Percents are considered to be equal if they are within 1% of each other.


4. In the Main method of the default class,

(a) demonstrate that the new extension method works correctly.

(b) demonstrate that objects of your dirt sample class can correctly be compared using the equality and
inequality operators (== and !=).


5. User input is optional.
